	abstract = {Abstract The phenomenon of positive aging, i.e., efficiency increased with time, is observed in quantum-dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs). For example, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of blue QLEDs is significantly improved from 4.93\% to 12.97\% after storage for 8 d. The origin of such positive aging is thoroughly investigated. The finding indicates that the interfacial reaction between Al cathode and ZnMgO electron transport layer accounts for such improvement. During shelf-aging, the Al slowly reacts with the oxygen from ZnMgO, and consequently, leads to the formation of AlOx and the production of oxygen vacancies in ZnMgO. The AlOx interlayer reduces the electron injection barrier while the oxygen vacancies increase the conductivity of ZnMgO and, as a result, the electron injection is effectively enhanced. Moreover, the AlOx can effectively suppress the quenching of excitons by metal electrode. Due to the enhancement of electron injection and suppression of exciton quenching, the aged blue, green, and red QLEDs exhibit a 2.6-, 1.3-, and 1.25-fold efficiency improvement, respectively. The studies disclose the origin of positive aging and provide a new insight into the exciton quenching mechanisms, which would be useful for further constructing efficient QLED devices.},

	abstract = {Transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy is a powerful time-resolved spectroscopic method used to track the evolution of excited-state processes through changes in the system's absorption spectrum. Early implementations of TA were confined to specialized laboratories, but the evolution of commercial turn-key systems has made the technique increasingly available to research groups across the world. Modern TA systems are capable of producing large datasets with high energetic and temporal resolution that are rich in photophysical information. However, processing, fitting, and interpreting TA spectra can be challenging due to the large number of excited-state features and instrumental artifacts. Many factors must be carefully considered when collecting, processing, and fitting TA data in order to reduce uncertainty over which model or set of fitting parameters best describes the data. The goal of data preparation and fitting is to reduce as many of these extraneous factors while preserving the data for analysis. In this method, beginners are provided with a protocol for processing and preparing TA data as well as a brief introduction to selected fitting procedures and models, specifically single wavelength fitting and global lifetime analysis. Commentary on a number of commonly encountered data preparation challenges and methods of addressing them is provided, followed by a discussion of the challenges and limitations of these simple fitting methods.},
